Here are some options for analysis:\n\n1. **Full fact-check of all claims** - Verify death tolls, arrest numbers, internet shutdowns, and Pahlavi's statements\n2. **Focus on casualty figures** - Cross-reference the 65 deaths and 2,500 arrests with multiple sources\n3. **Verify Pahlavi's actual statements** - Check his X/Twitter posts and compare with reported quotes\n4. **Timeline verification** - Confirm the sequence of events and their reported timing\n5. **Source reliability assessment** - Evaluate the credibility of HRANA, Hengaw, and other cited organizations\n6. **Trump statement verification** - Confirm the accuracy of the quoted remarks and their context\n\nWhich aspect would you like me to focus on first, or would you prefer a comprehensive analysis of all claims in the article?"
